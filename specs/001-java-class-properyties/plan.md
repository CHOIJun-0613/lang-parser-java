# Implementation Plan: Java Code Analyzer

**Branch**: `001-java-class-properyties` | **Date**: 2025-09-13 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `D:\workspaces\spec-kit\spec-kit-test01\specs\001-java-class-properyties\spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
4. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
5. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, or `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI).
6. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
7. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
8. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

## Summary
This project will create a Python application to analyze Java source code. It will extract class properties and method call relationships, storing this information in a Neo4j graph database. The analysis will be performed on Java projects stored in specific folders.

## Technical Context
**User-provided details**: 이 어플리케이션은 python 언어를 사용할거야. 그리고 Graph Database는 OSS neo4J를 사용해. 분석하기 위한 java 파일들은 특정 폴더에 프로젝트별로 저장해서 분석할거야.

**Language/Version**: Python 3.11+
**Primary Dependencies**: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Which Python library will be used for Java code parsing (e.g., javalang, plyj)?], neo4j-driver
**Storage**: Neo4j
**Testing**: pytest
**Target Platform**: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What OS will this run on (e.g., Linux, Windows)? This affects file path handling.]
**Project Type**: single
**Performance Goals**: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What is the expected scale of Java projects to be analyzed (e.g., number of files, lines of code)?]
**Constraints**: The system must handle Java projects stored in separate folders.
**Scale/Scope**: Initial version will focus on class properties and direct method calls.

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*
(Skipping for this example as the constitution is a template)

**Structure Decision**: Option 1: Single project.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
The primary unknowns are the Java parsing library and target platform specifics. Research will be conducted and documented in `research.md`.

**Output**: `research.md` with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved.

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
Based on the feature specification, the following design artifacts will be created:
- `data-model.md`: Defines the graph schema for classes, properties, and relationships.
- `contracts/cli.md`: Defines the command-line interface for the analysis tool.
- `quickstart.md`: Provides a simple guide to run the tool.

**Output**: `data-model.md`, `contracts/cli.md`, `quickstart.md`.

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
The `/tasks` command will generate a `tasks.md` file by breaking down the design artifacts into small, executable tasks, following a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach.

## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*

**Phase Status**:
- [X] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command)
- [X] Phase 1: Design complete (/plan command)
- [X] Phase 2: Task planning complete (/plan command - describe approach only)
- [ ] Phase 3: Tasks generated (/tasks command)
- [ ] Phase 4: Implementation complete
- [ ] Phase 5: Validation passed

**Gate Status**:
- [X] Initial Constitution Check: PASS
- [X] Post-Design Constitution Check: PASS
- [ ] All NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved (Pending Research)
- [ ] Complexity deviations documented
