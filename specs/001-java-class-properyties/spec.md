# Feature Specification: Java Code Analyzer and Graph DB Manager

**Feature Branch**: `001-java-class-properyties`  
**Created**: 2025-09-13  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "java 프로그램을 분석해서 각 class의 properyties를 관리하고 class가 method 호출관계를 관리할 거야. 분석정보를 Graph DB에 저장하고 관리 하기위한 프로그램을 개발하려고 해."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement must be testable
   → Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   → If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   → If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines
- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer, I want to analyze a Java project to understand its class structure, properties, and method call relationships, so that I can visualize and manage this information in a graph database.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a path to a Java project, **When** the analysis is run, **Then** the system should identify all classes, their properties, and the methods they call.
2. **Given** the analysis is complete, **When** I query the graph database for a specific class, **Then** I should see its properties and its connections to other classes via method calls.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the Java code has syntax errors?
- How does the system handle interfaces, abstract classes, and inheritance?
- What if the specified path does not contain a Java project?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST parse Java source code files.
- **FR-002**: System MUST identify class definitions within the source code.
- **FR-003**: System MUST extract the properties (fields/variables) for each class.
- **FR-004**: System MUST identify method call relationships between classes.
- **FR-005**: System MUST store the extracted class, property, and method call information in a graph database.
- **FR-006**: The graph database schema MUST represent classes as nodes and method calls as edges. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What specific graph DB schema should be used? What properties should nodes and edges have?]
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide a way to initiate the analysis of a Java project. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should this be a CLI command, a GUI, or an API?]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Class**: Represents a Java class. Attributes: name, package, file path.
- **Property**: Represents a field within a class. Attributes: name, type.
- **MethodCall**: Represents a method call from a source class to a target class. Attributes: source method, target method.
